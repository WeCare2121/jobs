Sendwithus is looking for a talented and passionate Engineering Intern to join our team in Victoria BC. You'll be working alongside our Product and Platform Engineering Teams to design, build, and scale technical solutions our customers will love.

In your first month, you will…
    • Learn what Sendwithus does and who our customers are
    • Participate in engineering planning and design meetings
    • Complete your starter project and deploy real code to production

By the end of your term, you will…
    • Ship a major update to a customer facing feature or platform service
    • Use large datasets to develop and prioritize system improvements
    • Measure project success metrics and implement optimizations
    • Have real-world experience building and deploying complex web applications

This role is not specific to frontend, backend, or full-stack development. We have opportunities at all levels of the tech stack, and want to work with you to find projects that are both meaningful to you and interesting to work on.

The Sendwithus Story
Sendwithus powers email communication for large online businesses. Our system handles thousands of users and more than 15 Million emails every day, ranging from real-time notifications and invoices to personalized marketing campaigns and product updates. Our customers include Microsoft, Zillow, DonorsChoose, and Teespring - in fact, we're already one of the top 300 email senders in the world. We were part of Y Combinator's W14 batch, have offices in both Victoria and San Francisco, and have raised more than $2.5 Million from some of the top tech investors in the world.

Under the hood, Sendwithus is a high-throughput email platform and delivery pipeline built with Go, Python, and JavaScript. Our technical challenges vary from building powerful UI workflows to managing hundreds of servers and thousands of GB of data every day.

Applying
Send two sentences introducing yourself, an updated resume, and a YouTube link to jobs@sendwithus.com. 

The YouTube video should be no longer than 90 seconds and feature yourself talking about something you're passionate about. This can include programming projects and assignments but doesn't have to. The video can be private and we promise to not share it outside of our hiring team. Production value will not be considered - the video should be unscripted and unedited (we care about getting to know you, not your video production skills).

We look forward to meeting you!
